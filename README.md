# unhvd-native-android
A convenience repository that pulls together the mlsp, hvd (sw!), nhvd, unhvd code to build a native shared library for the [nreal-unity-nhvd](https://github.com/CitizenOneX/nreal-unity-nhvd) project.
Each of these repositories have been forked to get working on the Windows/NVIDIA encoding and decoding sides, but for Android decoding there need to be some changes.
